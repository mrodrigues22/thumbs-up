Run the following after completing AI feature scaffolding:

# Add migration for new tables (ContentFeatures, ClientSummaries) and modified Submission
# Ensure dotnet-ef tools installed: dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

dotnet ef migrations add AddAiFeatures --project ThumbsUpApi --startup-project ThumbsUpApi

dotnet ef database update --project ThumbsUpApi --startup-project ThumbsUpApi

If you need to regenerate:
- Delete the generated migration files, then re-run commands.

Note: Relationship added: Submission <-> ContentFeature (1:1) and Client <-> ClientSummary (1:1).

OpenAI Responses API Update (Nov 2025):
- Deprecated request field `response_format` replaced by nested `text.format`.
- Code updated in `DTOs/OpenAiResponseDTOs.cs` and `Services/OpenAiTextService.cs`.
- If you previously pinned an older SDK, ensure it supports the new structure or adjust manually.
- Rebuild containers (`docker-compose up --build`) after pulling this change.
 - Vision image parameter corrected: use `image_url` (with uploaded file id) instead of deprecated/invalid `image_file_id`.
	 Update applied in `DTOs/OpenAiResponseDTOs.cs`, `OpenAiOcrService.cs`, and `OpenAiThemeService.cs`.
