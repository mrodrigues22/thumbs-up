Run the following after completing AI feature scaffolding:

# Add migration for new tables (ContentFeatures, ClientSummaries) and modified Submission
# Ensure dotnet-ef tools installed: dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

dotnet ef migrations add AddAiFeatures --project ThumbsUpApi --startup-project ThumbsUpApi

dotnet ef database update --project ThumbsUpApi --startup-project ThumbsUpApi

If you need to regenerate:
- Delete the generated migration files, then re-run commands.

Note: Relationship added: Submission <-> ContentFeature (1:1) and Client <-> ClientSummary (1:1).
